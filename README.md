# SpaceTrader 2142
## Elevator Pitch
SpaceTrader 2142 is a turn-based strategy game where corporations compete to
build vast empires of trade routes, industry and more - in space (you know,
like, outer space)! The game will feature an emphasis on trade and economics and
will slightly de-emphasize "combat" and battles.

## Inspirations
""SpaceTrader"" has many inspirations, and some of them are listed here:
* [Railroads! and the Railroad Tycoon games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railroad_Tycoon_(series)) 
* [The Civilization series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(series)) 
* [The Galactic Civilizations series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Civilizations) 
* [Barron Realms Elite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barren_Realms_Elite) 
* [Trade Wars 2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TradeWars_2002) 

And more!

## Resources
We will eventually have more information as things progress. Currently we are in
the "design" phase of the game - figuring out how gameplay will generally go,
the different aspects of the game universe, and etc.

## Open Source
SpaceTrader 2142 is an open source game. That means the source code will
always be available for you to tweak and modify. We are currently exploring open
source license types.

## Governing Board
There will be a board for the source code and development aspects of the
project. Creative and design elements are not subject to board governance.

## Founders
Information on the project's founders is coming soon.
